## Testing

### W3C Validation Testing

#### W3C HTML validation

The main index.html file was put through the official [W3C Markdown Validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) services returning no errors or warnings.

- Info notes were included as React uses JSX and not ure HTML.

#### W3C Css validation

All files were put through the official [W3C Css Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) services returning no errors or warnings.

- **To note:** I have only included one screenshot of the App.module.css file as all of them were exactly the same and did not have an incidation of the file name.

### ES Lint Testing

All files were put through ES lint validation using the terminal. No errors were found.

## Bugs

### Fixed bugs

**error 400: request failed with status code 400**

![400 error image](documentation/images/errors/error-400-bidcreateform.png)

- I received a 400 error when testing the bid submission. The issue was to do with the phone number field type.
  - I resolved this by removing the field from the Bid model in the back-end as it was not crucial for the bid functionality.

**Bid price field error message would not hide once a new value was input**

![input validation](documentation/images/errors/input-validation.png)

- When testing the bid price input field, I noticed that the error message would not hide when a new bid value was written, even after the submission.
- I managed to resolve this by resetting the error state. I used this snippet of code from [Medium](https://medium.com/@rbscoop2611/most-efficient-way-to-add-warning-messages-under-forms-input-field-472f2b70bb72):
  ```Python
          if (errors[name]) {
              setErrors(prevErrors => ({
                  ...prevErrors,
                  [name]: null
              }));
          }
  ```

**Hide Bid component for the seller**

- When working on the Bid component display, I decided to hide the bid form from the users who were selling the artwork. This way the sellers were only able to see the submitted bids and avoid bidding on their own artworks.
  - I used `!artwork.results[0]?.is_owner` in the ternary condition to render the bid form for the buyers only.

**Concatenating url link**

![concatenation error](documentation/images/errors/concatenated-url-error.png)

- when testing my deployed react website, I noticed that the url for creating an artwork listing was broken. Upon each click on the “create artwork”, “artwork” would be concatenated at the end
- I managed to resolve this by adding a missing / at the beginning of the link path in the NavBar.js file.

**no image upload error**

![no-image-error.png](documentation/images/errors/no-image-error.png)

- When testing Artwork creation, I received the pictured error if no image was selected even though it was an optional field to submit.
  - I managed to resolve this by replacing the existing image related code in ArtworkCreateForm.js with this:
    ```jsx
    if (imageInput?.current?.files[0]) {
      formData.append("image", imageInput.current.files[0]);
    }
    ```

**Distorted NavBar view**

- when styling the navbar I noticed that in the mobile view on smaller screens the proportions of the screen got distorted. This was because of the Most selling profile componenet was set to show 4 profiles.
- I managed to resolve this problem by adding the below rules to the main App class in the App.js.
  - I have also reduced the number of profiles listed to 3, in order to prevent this error. However, I will be looking at implementing horizontal scrolling at the next development stage.
  ```css
  max-width: 100vw;
  overflow-x: hidden;
  ```

**Style and type filters returning non explicit data**

- I noticed that my style filter was returning entries for “other” for style and type of artwork.
  - I resolved this by replacing the "search=" with "style=" and "type=" in each useEffect for style and type. this seems to have resolved the issue.

**Artwork sold status not appearing straight away**

- Similarly, when testing my app, I noticed that the artwork was displaying sold status only after refreshing the page.
- I realised that I needed to update the artwork sold status in order to get the “Sold” statement appear upon clicking “Mark as sold” button.
  - I managed to get that working by altering the setBid code snippet to setArtwork snippet.
  - I found this part of React documentation useful: [React documentation - updating state](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state)

**Missing dependency in SignUpForm**

- When rendering the images for the carousel, I received `React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'artwork Images'. Either include it or remove the dependency array react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warning in devtools console.
  - This warning was irrelevant as using the dependency would have made the effect to rerender on each image, which was not needed.
    - I applied `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` to disable the warning, which I found in these two StackOverflow threads:
      - [how to fix missing dependency](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55840294/how-to-fix-missing-dependency-warning-when-using-useeffect-react-hook)
      - [how to fix react hook useeffect has a missing dependency](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64499336/how-to-fix-react-hook-useeffect-has-a-missing-dependency-either-include-it-or)
      - **to note:** es lint comment has been removed and a cleanup function added to address the memory leak error.

**Cancel button in username/password edit forms**

- When testing the change username and password forms, I noticed that when the user clicked on the cancel button, the following errors were thrown:
  ![toast message error](documentation/images/errors/toast-cancel-error.png)
  ![console error](documentation/images/errors/memory-400-errors.png)
  - These errors seem to have appeared because I forgot to set the button element type to button.
    - After adding `type=button` to the button element for the cancel form functionality, the errors have resolved.

**Flickering pointer in Profile component**

- Flickering pointer over the toolpit in the Top sellers section was caused by overlapping Tooltip and css rules for the icons.
  - I managed to resolve this by setting hover effect to a different div element.

**Unmounted Image carousel component**

![unmounted error](documentation/images/errors/unmounted-error.jpg)

- The above error was showing up, when the user signs into their account.

  - To fix it, I added a cleanup function, using the code in the image as an example.

  ![Unmount example](documentation/images/errors/cleanup-example.png)

### Unfixed bugs

- When testing the website, I noticed that there is a discrepancy in the artwork edit once it is sold fuctionality.
  - It appears that once the atwork is marked as sold, if the seller chooses to edit the artwork, it is listed again as if it was not sold in the artwork list view. However, the user doesn't seem to be able to interact with it afresh, which does not cause any issues apart from misleading and confusing information displayed to the user.
  - I have circumvented this issue by disabling the edit functionality for the seller once the artwork is marked as sold.

- The following errors noted in the console are expected to be present as per Moments walkthrough note, therefore I have not addressed these at this development stage:

### Lighthouse testing

Website performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO were tested using Lighthouse web performance testing tool. The tests were carried out using Google Chrome.

The scores have been marked down due to the use of external CDNs and Cloudinary storage.

### Accessibility

The project was run through Wave evaluation tool and WCAG Colour contrast checker.

**Wave**

- Couple of errors were returned for the Sign up and Sign in pages, indicating lack of labels for input fields.
  - Lack of labels was a design choice, aiming for a clean design and indicating the purpose of each input field through the use of placeholder text.
- No other errors were detected when passing through Wave evaluation tool.

**WCAG**

- I ensured that sufficient color contrast is provided when choosing the color palette. I used [Contrast Grid tool](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) to ensure that the colors are well-chosen.
  - #F4442E color against the #F9F8F8 background did not pass through AA and AAA standards.
    - It was a design choice to use this colour as an accent color for hover effects, active classes in the Navigation bar and the sold ribbon.
- No other issues were noted.

The project was tested against the following devices and browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Google Chrome Dev
- Firefox
- Explorer
- Google Pixel 7
- Galaxy s10
- Galaxy Tab A
- iPhone 7
  - the website was working prior to adding the Procfile to the main root. There is a known bug with the setup on iOS for the separate frontend and backend versions of this project, and I will be looking at addressing this at the next development stage.
